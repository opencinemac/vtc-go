Seconds returns the rational representation of the real-world seconds that would have

What it is

The number of real-world seconds that have elapsed between 00:00:00:00 and the timecode
value. With NTSC timecode, the timecode drifts from the real-world elapsed time.

Where you see it

- Anywhere real-world time needs to be calculated.
- In code that needs to do lossless calculations of playback time not rely on frame
  count, like adding two timecodes together with different framerates.

Timecode returns the the formatted SMPTE timecode: (ex: 01:00:00:00).

What it is

Timecode is used as a human-readable way to represent the id of a given frame. It is
formatted to give a rough sense of where to find a frame:
{HOURS}:{MINUTES}:{SECONDS}:{FRAME}. For more on timecode, see Frame.io's
[excellent post](https://blog.frame.io/2017/07/17/timecode-and-frame-rates/) on the
subject.

Where you see it

Timecode is ubiquitous in video editing, a small sample of places you might see
timecode:

- Source and Playback monitors in your favorite NLE.
- Burned into the footage for dailies.
- Cut lists like an EDL.

Warning

Currently, this method will panic on framerates where the timebase is not a whole
integer.

/*
Frames returns the number of frames that would have elapsed between 00:00:00:00 and this

What it is

Frame number / frames count is the number of a frame if the timecode started at
00:00:00:00 and had been running until the current value. A timecode of '00:00:00:10'
has a frame number of 10. A timecode of '01:00:00:00' has a frame number of 86400.

Where you see it

/*
FeetAndFrames returns the number of feet and frames this timecode represents if it were
shot on 35mm 4-perf film (16 frames per foot). ex: '5400+13'.

What it is

On physical film, each foot contains a certain number of frames. For 35mm, 4-perf film
(the most common type on Hollywood movies), this number is 16 frames per foot.
Feet-And-Frames was often used in place of Keycode to quickly reference a frame in the
edit.

Where you see it

For the most part, feet + frames has died out as a reference, because digital media is
not measured in feet. The most common place it is still used is Studio Sound
Departments. Many Sound Mixers and Designers intuitively think in feet + frames, and it
is often burned into the reference picture for them.

- Telecine.
- Sound turnover reference picture.
- Sound turnover change lists.

framerate in Premiere.
